# Replit Configuration

## Overview

This appears to be an Android mod menu application built in Java/Kotlin. The repository contains ProGuard/R8 obfuscation rules for an Android app with a floating mod menu service and main activity. The application is designed to provide modding functionality for Android games or applications through a floating overlay interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Android Application Structure**
- Built as a standard Android application with manifest-defined components
- Uses ProGuard/R8 for code obfuscation and optimization during the build process
- Implements a service-based architecture for the floating mod menu functionality

**Core Components**
- `MainActivity`: Main entry point and primary user interface
- `FloatingModMenuService`: Background service that manages the floating overlay mod menu
- Both components are protected from obfuscation to ensure proper Android system integration

**Build System**
- Uses Android's standard build tools (likely Gradle-based)
- Implements code shrinking and obfuscation through ProGuard/R8
- Generated rules ensure critical components remain accessible to the Android framework

## External Dependencies

**Android Framework**
- Standard Android SDK components
- Android overlay permissions for floating window functionality
- Service lifecycle management through Android system

**Build Tools**
- ProGuard/R8 for code optimization and obfuscation
- Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT) for resource processing
- Standard Android build toolchain
